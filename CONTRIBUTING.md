# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for considering a contribution! To keep the codebase consistent and easy to review, please follow these rules:

## Coding style

- **Newlines:** Always use Unix line endings (`\n`).
- **Quotes:** Prefer double quotes (`"`) over single quotes (`'`) wherever possible.
- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indent level. Do not use tabs.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
3. Open a pull request against `main` with a concise description of your changes.

## Code review

- Reviewers may request style fixes if the above rules are not followed.
- Maintainers will not merge pull requests until the style is correct.

Thanks again for helping improve the project!
